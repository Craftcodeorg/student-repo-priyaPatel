### Assignment: Analyzing Marketing Data with Python

#### Problem Statement:
As a Marketing Data Analyst in the healthcare industry, you are tasked with analyzing marketing campaign data to understand consumer behavior. Your goal is to create a Python script that reads a CSV file containing marketing data and prints the first five rows. This will help you visualize the data and identify trends that can inform future marketing strategies.

#### Starter Code:
Below is the starter code that sets up the environment for reading a CSV file using the Pandas library. You will need to modify this code to complete the task.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Function to read and display marketing data
def read_marketing_data(file_path):
    # Step 1: Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
    marketing_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Step 2: Print the first five rows of the DataFrame
    print(marketing_data.head())

# Example usage (you will replace 'your_file.csv' with the actual file path)
# read_marketing_data('your_file.csv')
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with the Pandas library. If not, you can install Pandas using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

2. **Modify the Function**:
   - In the `read_marketing_data` function, you need to replace `'your_file.csv'` with the path to your actual CSV file containing marketing data.
   - The function currently reads the CSV and prints the first five rows. Ensure that you understand how `pd.read_csv()` works.

3. **Test the Function**:
   - After modifying the file path, run your script to see if it correctly reads and displays the first five rows of your marketing data.
   - If your CSV file has specific columns (like 'Date', 'Campaign', 'Clicks', etc.), ensure that these are displayed in the output.

4. **Enhance Your Output**:
   - As an optional step, consider enhancing your output by adding a brief description of the data displayed. For example, you could print a message before showing the data:
     ```python
     print("Here are the first five rows of the marketing data:")
     ```

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Add error handling to manage cases where the file might not exist or is not in the correct format. You can use a try-except block to catch exceptions when reading the CSV file.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Correctness**: The script must correctly read the CSV file and display the first five rows.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices for Python programming.
- **Error Handling**: The script should handle potential errors gracefully, providing user-friendly messages when issues arise.
- **Output Clarity**: The printed output should be clear and easy to understand, including any additional context you provide.

#### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your Python script file (.py) with the completed function and any additional enhancements you've made.
- Ensure that your CSV file is included or provide a link to download it if it's hosted online.

This assignment will help you apply key concepts from the lecture on Python for Data Analysis, particularly in the context of Healthcare Marketing, as you work towards your goal of becoming a Marketing Data Analyst. Good luck!
