### Module Title: Introduction to Python for Data Analysis

### Exercise 1: Create a List of Marketing Metrics

#### 1. Problem Statement
As a Marketing Data Analyst in the Healthcare Marketing industry, you are tasked with analyzing the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns. To do this, you need to create a list of key marketing metrics that will help you evaluate the performance of these campaigns. Using Python, you will create a list of these metrics and visualize how they can impact decision-making processes in your organization.

**Scenario**: You are given the following marketing metrics to evaluate: `Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)`, `Return on Investment (ROI)`, `Conversion Rate`, `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`, and `Churn Rate`. Your goal is to create a Python list that includes these metrics and then visualize one of them using a simple bar chart.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Create a list of marketing metrics
metrics = [______, ______, ______, ______, ______]  # Fill in the blanks with the marketing metrics

# Step 2: Create a DataFrame to visualize one of the metrics
data = {
    'Metrics': ['Customer Acquisition Cost', 'Return on Investment', 'Conversion Rate', 'Customer Lifetime Value', 'Churn Rate'],
    'Values': [______, ______, ______, ______, ______]  # Fill in with hypothetical values for each metric
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 3: Visualize the metrics using a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Metrics'], df['Values'], color='blue')
plt.title('Marketing Metrics Visualization')
plt.xlabel('Metrics')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.show()
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: For the list of metrics, think about what key performance indicators are crucial for evaluating marketing success.
- **Hint 2**: When filling in the values for your DataFrame, you can use any hypothetical numbers that represent the performance of your campaigns.
- **Hint 3**: Ensure that your bar chart is clear and easy to read; consider adjusting colors or labels if necessary.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Create a list of essential marketing metrics relevant to your role as a Marketing Data Analyst.
- Populate a DataFrame with these metrics and their respective values.
- Generate a bar chart that visually represents one or more of these metrics, demonstrating your understanding of data visualization principles.

Your final solution should include:
- A correctly filled-in list of marketing metrics.
- Appropriate values that reflect realistic scenarios.
- A well-commented code that explains each step taken to achieve the final visualization.

This exercise not only reinforces your understanding of Python's application in marketing data analysis but also helps you build a foundational portfolio project that showcases your skills in data visualization.
