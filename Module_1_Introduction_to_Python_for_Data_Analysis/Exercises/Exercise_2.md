### Module Title: Introduction to Python for Data Analysis

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
As a Marketing Data Analyst in the healthcare marketing industry, you often need to analyze consumer spending data to derive insights that can guide your marketing strategies. In this exercise, you will be given a list of consumer spending amounts, and your task is to convert this list into a NumPy array. This will allow you to perform numerical operations more efficiently, which is essential for analyzing trends and patterns in consumer behavior.

**Scenario**: You have collected the following spending amounts from three different consumers on healthcare products:

- Consumer A: $100
- Consumer B: $150
- Consumer C: $200

You need to convert this list of spending amounts into a NumPy array to facilitate further analysis.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
# Importing the NumPy library
import numpy as np

# List of consumer spending amounts
spending_list = [100, 150, 200]

# Convert the list to a NumPy array
spending_array = np.array(__________)

# Display the NumPy array
print("Consumer Spending as NumPy Array:", spending_array)

# Example operation: Calculate the total spending
total_spending = np.sum(__________)
print("Total Spending Amount:", total_spending)
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: To convert a list into a NumPy array, you will use the `np.array()` function. Make sure to pass the correct variable that holds the list of spending amounts.
- **Hint 2**: For calculating the total spending, you can use the `np.sum()` function, which takes an array as an argument. Ensure that you are passing the variable that contains the NumPy array you created.
- **Hint 3**: Remember that NumPy arrays allow for efficient numerical computations. Think about how this could be useful when analyzing larger datasets in your marketing projects.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
Upon completing the exercise, you should have a correctly filled-in code that converts the list of consumer spending amounts into a NumPy array and calculates the total spending. The final output should look like this:

```
Consumer Spending as NumPy Array: [100 150 200]
Total Spending Amount: 450
```

The code should be well-commented, explaining each step, especially how converting a list to a NumPy array can facilitate data analysis in your role as a Marketing Data Analyst. By successfully completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding of how to apply Python concepts to real-world scenarios in healthcare marketing.
