# Assignment: Create a Bar Chart Showing the ROI of Three Different Marketing Campaigns

## Problem Statement
As a Marketing Data Analyst in the healthcare industry, it is crucial to visualize the return on investment (ROI) of various marketing campaigns to make informed decisions. In this assignment, you will create a bar chart that compares the ROI of three different marketing campaigns. This visualization will help stakeholders understand which campaigns are most effective in generating revenue relative to their costs.

## Starter Code
Below is a basic code framework that you will expand upon. The starter code includes sample data for three marketing campaigns and sets up the environment for creating a bar chart using both Matplotlib and Seaborn.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for marketing campaigns
data = {
    'Campaign': ['Email Marketing', 'Social Media', 'PPC'],
    'Cost': [2000, 3000, 1500],  # Cost of each campaign
    'Revenue': [5000, 7000, 4000]  # Revenue generated by each campaign
}

# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate ROI for each campaign
df['ROI'] = (df['Revenue'] - df['Cost']) / df['Cost'] * 100

# Starter plotting code (students will build upon this)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Campaign', y='ROI', data=df)
plt.title('ROI of Marketing Campaigns')
plt.xlabel('Campaign Type')
plt.ylabel('ROI (%)')
plt.show()
```

## Detailed Instructions
### Step 1: Understand the Data
- Review the sample data provided in the starter code. It contains information about the cost and revenue for three different marketing campaigns.
- The ROI is calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100
  \]

### Step 2: Modify the Code
- Ensure that the ROI is correctly calculated and added to the DataFrame.
- You may want to enhance the visualization by adding labels to each bar to indicate the exact ROI percentage.

### Step 3: Customize the Visualization
- Experiment with different color palettes available in Seaborn to improve the aesthetics of your bar chart.
- Add grid lines to your plot for better readability.

### Step 4: Enhance Output
- Modify the plot to include annotations that display the exact ROI value on top of each bar. Use `plt.text()` to place text on the bars.

### Step 5: Document Your Code
- Ensure your code is well-commented, explaining what each section does and how it contributes to creating the visualization.

## Criteria for Success and Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- **Accuracy**: The ROI is calculated correctly, and the bar chart accurately represents this data.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices. Comments are included to explain key parts.
- **Visualization**: The bar chart is visually appealing, with appropriate titles, labels, and annotations.
- **Creativity**: Any additional enhancements or customizations you implement will be taken into account.

By completing this assignment, you will reinforce your understanding of data visualization concepts using Matplotlib and Seaborn while applying them to real-world marketing scenarios in healthcare. Good luck!
