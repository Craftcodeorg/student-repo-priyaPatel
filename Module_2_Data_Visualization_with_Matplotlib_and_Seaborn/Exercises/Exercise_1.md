### Module Title: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with analyzing consumer behavior trends for a healthcare marketing campaign over the past six months. Your goal is to visualize how the engagement with the campaign has changed over time. You will create a line chart that represents the number of interactions (e.g., clicks, inquiries) with your marketing materials each month. This exercise will help you apply the concepts covered in the lecture about data visualization and its significance in marketing analytics.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is a starter code template that you will need to complete to visualize the consumer behavior trends. Fill in the blanks to create a line chart using Matplotlib.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Sample data representing monthly interactions
   months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun']
   interactions = [______ , ______ , ______ , ______ , ______ , ______]  # Fill in the number of interactions for each month

   # Creating the line graph
   plt.plot(months, interactions, marker='o')  # Use 'o' to mark data points
   plt.title('Consumer Engagement Trends Over Time')  # Title of the graph
   plt.xlabel('Months')  # Label for x-axis
   plt.ylabel('Number of Interactions')  # Label for y-axis
   plt.grid(True)  # Add grid for better readability
   plt.show()  # Display the graph
   ```

3. **Hints**: 
   - Think about what kind of data you might collect from your marketing campaign. For example, consider how many people clicked on your ads or visited your website each month.
   - Refer back to the concepts of clarity and relevance from the lecture. Make sure that your visualization clearly communicates the trends you want to highlight.
   - Remember to use consistent and clear labels for your axes to enhance understanding.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   After filling in the blanks, your code should successfully generate a line chart showing consumer engagement trends over time. The chart will visually represent how interactions with your marketing campaign have fluctuated across the six months. Your final solution should adhere to best practices, including:
   - Properly labeling axes and providing a clear title.
   - Using comments to explain each part of your code.
   - Ensuring that you handle any potential errors (e.g., ensuring that the length of `interactions` matches `months`).

### Integration
- Ensure that this exercise is structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links for further reading or reference.

By completing this exercise, you will not only practice your coding skills but also reinforce your understanding of how to effectively visualize data in a way that can influence marketing strategies in the healthcare industry.
