### Module Title: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   As a Marketing Data Analyst in the healthcare industry, you are tasked with analyzing the performance of various marketing channels over the past year. You have collected data on the number of leads generated and the conversion rates from different marketing strategies (e.g., email campaigns, social media ads, and PPC). Your goal is to visualize this data using a heatmap to identify which marketing strategies performed best. 

   Create a heatmap using Seaborn that displays the conversion rates across different channels and months. This will help you quickly identify trends and make informed decisions on where to allocate your marketing budget.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is the starter code that you will complete. Fill in the blanks to create a heatmap using Seaborn.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Sample data for marketing performance metrics
   data = {
       'Channel': ['Email', 'Social Media', 'PPC'],
       'Jan': [0.10, 0.15, 0.20],
       'Feb': [0.12, 0.18, 0.22],
       'Mar': [0.14, 0.20, 0.25],
       'Apr': [0.15, 0.25, 0.30]
   }

   # Create a DataFrame
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Set the 'Channel' column as index
   df.set_index('Channel', inplace=True)

   # Create a heatmap using Seaborn
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.heatmap(df, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu', linewidths=.5)

   # Add titles and labels
   plt.title('Marketing Performance Metrics Heatmap')
   plt.xlabel('Month')
   plt.ylabel('Marketing Channel')

   # Show the plot
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Remember to use `pd.DataFrame()` to create a DataFrame from your dictionary of data.
   - Use `set_index()` to set the 'Channel' column as the index for better visualization.
   - The `sns.heatmap()` function can take parameters like `annot=True` to display the data values on the heatmap.
   - Consider adjusting the `cmap` parameter to choose a color palette that enhances readability.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   Upon completing this exercise, you should have a heatmap that clearly visualizes the conversion rates for different marketing channels across the months of January to April. The final code should include comments explaining each step and follow best practices for readability and maintainability. You should also handle any potential errors gracefully, such as checking if the DataFrame is empty before plotting.

### Integration 
- This exercise is structured to promote critical thinking and practical application of data visualization techniques discussed in the lecture. 
- Ensure that you review your code for clarity and completeness before submission.
- Use markdown formatting for easy readability when integrating into your learning platform. 

By completing this exercise, you will enhance your skills in data visualization using Python and Seaborn while gaining insights into marketing performance that are crucial for your career as a Marketing Data Analyst in healthcare marketing.
