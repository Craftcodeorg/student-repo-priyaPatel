# Module Title: Marketing Analytics with Python

## Example 3: Automating Report Generation with Python Scripts

### 1. Introduction
Automating report generation with Python scripts is a significant advancement for Marketing Data Analysts, particularly in the healthcare marketing sector. This example builds upon the key concepts from the lecture on analyzing marketing campaign performance using Python. By automating reports, analysts can efficiently track and present campaign performance metrics such as ROI, conversion rates, and customer engagement. This not only saves time but also ensures that stakeholders receive timely insights to make informed decisions.

### 2. Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a beginner-friendly Python code snippet that demonstrates how to automate the generation of a marketing performance report using techniques discussed in the lecture:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

# Sample data for marketing campaigns
data = {
    'Campaign': ['Ad1', 'Ad2', 'Ad3'],
    'Cost': [1000, 1500, 2000],
    'Revenue': [5000, 7000, 3000]
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to calculate ROI
def calculate_roi(dataframe):
    try:
        dataframe['ROI'] = (dataframe['Revenue'] - dataframe['Cost']) / dataframe['Cost'] * 100
        return dataframe
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calculating ROI: {e}")
        return None

# Function to generate a report
def generate_report(dataframe):
    try:
        # Calculate ROI
        report_df = calculate_roi(dataframe)
        
        # Save the report to a CSV file
        report_df.to_csv('marketing_report.csv', index=False)
        print("Report saved as 'marketing_report.csv'")

        # Visualize the ROI
        plt.bar(report_df['Campaign'], report_df['ROI'], color='skyblue')
        plt.title('ROI of Marketing Campaigns')
        plt.xlabel('Campaign')
        plt.ylabel('ROI (%)')
        
        # Save the plot
        plt.savefig('roi_plot.png')
        plt.show()
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating report: {e}")

# Execute the report generation function
generate_report(df)
```

### 3. Explanation
1. **Data Preparation**: The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining sample data for three marketing campaigns. This data includes campaign names, costs, and revenues.

2. **Calculate ROI Function**: The `calculate_roi` function computes the Return on Investment (ROI) for each campaign. It includes error handling to manage any exceptions that might occur during calculations.

3. **Generate Report Function**: The `generate_report` function calls `calculate_roi` to compute ROI and saves the resulting DataFrame to a CSV file named 'marketing_report.csv'. It also visualizes the ROI using a bar chart and saves the plot as 'roi_plot.png'.

4. **Execution**: Finally, the `generate_report` function is executed with the sample DataFrame, automating the entire reporting process.

This code addresses real-world challenges faced in healthcare marketing by providing an automated way to generate performance reports, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing manual errors.

### 4. Application
In healthcare marketing, timely and accurate reporting is essential for assessing campaign effectiveness and making strategic decisions. For instance, a healthcare organization running multiple digital ad campaigns can utilize this automated report generation script to quickly assess which campaigns yield the highest ROI and which require adjustments.

By automating this process, marketing teams can focus more on strategic planning and less on manual data entry and analysis. The ability to generate reports on-demand allows for better responsiveness to market changes and enhances overall marketing effectiveness.
