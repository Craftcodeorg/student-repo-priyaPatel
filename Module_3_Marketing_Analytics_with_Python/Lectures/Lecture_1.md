### 4. Practical Application:
#### Real-World Example:
In the healthcare sector, a hospital may use marketing analytics to track patient engagement through their website. By analyzing which pages are most visited and what information patients seek, they can tailor their content to better serve potential patients.

#### Code Snippet Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple Python snippet that uses a hypothetical dataset to visualize consumer behavior trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = {
    'Age Group': ['18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55+'],
    'Visits': [150, 300, 250, 200, 100]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plotting
plt.bar(df['Age Group'], df['Visits'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Website Visits by Age Group')
plt.xlabel('Age Group')
plt.ylabel('Number of Visits')
plt.show()
```
This code creates a bar chart visualizing how different age groups interact with a healthcare website, helping marketers tailor their strategies accordingly.
