# Assignment: Develop a Web Scraper for Consumer Feedback in Healthcare Marketing

### Problem Statement
In the context of healthcare marketing, understanding consumer feedback is essential for improving services and tailoring marketing strategies. Your task is to develop a web scraper that collects consumer feedback from an online platform (e.g., a healthcare service review website). The data you collect will help visualize consumer behavior trends, which is vital for making informed marketing decisions.

### Starter Code
Below is a basic framework for your web scraper using Python. This code utilizes the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to fetch and parse HTML content. You will need to expand upon this starter code to complete the assignment.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_feedback(url):
    # Step 1: Send a GET request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code}")
        return []
    
    # Step 2: Parse the HTML content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Step 3: Extract consumer feedback (modify this based on the website structure)
    feedback_list = []
    for feedback in soup.find_all('div', class_='feedback'):
        text = feedback.find('p').get_text()  # Adjust based on actual HTML structure
        rating = feedback.find('span', class_='rating').get_text()  # Adjust as needed
        feedback_list.append({'text': text, 'rating': rating})
    
    return feedback_list

# Example usage
url = 'https://example.com/healthcare-feedback'  # Replace with actual URL
consumer_feedback = scrape_feedback(url)
print(consumer_feedback)
```

### Detailed Instructions
1. **Modify the URL**: Replace `'https://example.com/healthcare-feedback'` with the actual URL of the healthcare service review website you want to scrape.

2. **Adjust HTML Parsing**:
   - Inspect the HTML structure of the target website to identify how feedback is organized.
   - Modify the `soup.find_all('div', class_='feedback')` line to match the actual class or tag used for consumer feedback on the website.
   - Similarly, adjust how you extract the text and rating from each feedback entry.

3. **Data Storage**: 
   - After collecting the feedback, consider storing it in a CSV file for further analysis. You can use the `pandas` library to create a DataFrame and save it.
   - Example code snippet for saving data:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     df = pd.DataFrame(consumer_feedback)
     df.to_csv('consumer_feedback.csv', index=False)
     ```

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - Implement error handling to manage potential issues such as network errors or changes in website structure. Ensure your code can handle exceptions gracefully.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test your scraper with different URLs and ensure that it correctly collects and parses consumer feedback.
   - Validate that the output matches your expectations in terms of structure and content.

### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality**: The web scraper successfully retrieves and parses consumer feedback from the specified URL.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices for Python programming.
- **Data Handling**: The collected data is stored appropriately (e.g., in a CSV file) for future analysis.
- **Error Management**: The code handles errors effectively without crashing.
- **Adherence to Instructions**: All steps in the assignment are completed as outlined.

### Conclusion
This assignment allows you to apply key concepts from marketing analytics, specifically focusing on data collection and visualization of consumer behavior trends. Completing this task will enhance your coding skills and contribute to your portfolio as you work towards your goal of becoming a Marketing Data Analyst in the healthcare sector. Happy coding!
